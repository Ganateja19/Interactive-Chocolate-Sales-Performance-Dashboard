# Interactive-Chocolate-Sales-Performance-Dashboard


## About the project
I built this **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze chocolate business performance across **products, countries, and time**.  
It helps quickly answer questions like:

- Which products are generating the most **sales and profit**?
- How are **monthly sales trends** changing?
- Where are we spending more on **costs** and how does that impact **profitability**?

The dashboard highlights key metrics such as **Sales, Boxes, Shipments, Costs, Profit, and Profit %**, with slicers and bookmarks to explore insights dynamically.
